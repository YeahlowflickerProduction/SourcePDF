Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the installation process and using the SourcePDF software. It provides a license to use the SourcePDF software and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.

If you register for a free trial of the SourcePDF software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the SourcePDF software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.

This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Yeahlowflicker Production herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Yeahlowflicker Production updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.

We are not responsible for any loss or damage that it may cause. You bear the entire risk as to its quality and performance.
